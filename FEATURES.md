# Features

* Animation: 
  * When you select a leg you can see it travel
* Show Stops button 
  * Reason: I didn't know how to render after my API call was done. 
* Draw Legs button (page has to be refreshed to clear the grid) 
  * Reason: This was mainly for testing to my API was getting all the data it needed and to be able to make sure all the legs were on the right coordinates
